# Push Notification

Some of the tests in this section require the Push Notification Feature Toggle to be enabled or disabled for the device. You can set this configuration on **`push-notification.rollout`** on Unleash.
To make sure the settings were correctly applied, close the app and open it again after each enable/disable toggle on Unleash, unless stated explicitly in the test steps.
